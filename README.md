# Optimizing Taxi Driver Allocation
 
**Objective:** To analyze time series data on taxi orders at airports and to develop a predictive model capable of accurately forecasting the number of taxi orders for the next hour, thereby allowing Sweet Lift Taxi to optimize driver allocation during peak hours.

**Accomplishment:** To pass this project, the model must have a root mean square error (RMSE) value of at most 48. My model, an LGBMRegressor, acquired a value of 41.79 on the test set.

**Skills Demonstrated:** Time series analysis, resampling, data visualization, feature engineering, and model evaluation
